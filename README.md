# helix

This is backup of service:

https://helix.startuplab.io

Initial commit contains only result of 

```
wget -np -r -k https://helix.startuplab.io
```

Without any backend code and builing methods (access: 12-02-2019).

It is not my code so you should no use it. It is licenced by 

> Ray Alez <raymestalez@gmail.com>

And now maintained by Ray. Repository was created because of 502 and afraid that service should be re created.

So wyhy this project?

- I want to create mechnism of synchronization with dropbox like in keeweb for my personal usage.
- I want to decrypt it.
- I want to propose this feature for helix when will be finished.

Current status of this repo: `blocked by: READ PRO GIT BOOK`, waiting for realisation.
Estimated time of delivery feature: half of 2019.
